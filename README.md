## Index


The bible API was created in order to have a low cost bible api application, you can find many bible api, but in most of them you will find applications based on node, so i decided to make a simple bible api available in laravel (PHP ), to be used in a simpler way, even in shared hosting environments.

## Dependencies

I recommend using the [laradocker](https://laradock.io/) container, it will assemble the entire environment for you, with simple settings you will run the application, soon I will be making the docker file available, to be cloned.
